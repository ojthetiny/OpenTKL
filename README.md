 - Jane V2 CE plate.
 - 3 optional internal weight pieces can be filled with foam for dampening or metal for more heft.

Important Info (READ BEFORE ORDERING):
 - I do not offer any sort of warranty for this, nor can I be held liable if something goes wrong.
 - Renders are not fully representative of the final product.
 - Please, PLEASE look over the design before you do anything with it, it's possible and very likely that there are some errors, I'm just a human.

If you use this as a template for your own design, please give credit(same goes for renders).
